<h2>SS-2001-01 Portable Lattice-Boltzmann in Java</h2>
<p>
Summer Scholarship Programme at the Edinburgh Parallel Computing
Centre, University of Edinburgh. 
Summer 2001<br/>
From: 02/07/2001 To: 10/09/2001 (10 weeks)<br/>
</p>
<h3> Project Summary</h3>
<p>
The aim of this project is to develop a medium-scale realistic application in Java. The basis for this project will be an existing code, called LUDWIG, which is written in C (and MPI). The major part of this project will consist of translating the sequential C code into Java. This will allow direct performance comparison between the two versions. As a further part of the project, parallel versions of the Java code (using mpiJava and/or JOMP) will be developed and benchmarked.

EPCC no longer has a copy of the SSP projects (they were deleted when the 
site was reorganized in 2007).
United Kingdom High-End Computing also kept a copy of the reports, but the project has now been discontinued.
