        abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) has found application in many fields including art history, education, research, and smart industry. Immersive 3D screens, large-scale displays, and CAVE systems are time-tested VR installations in research and scientific visualization. In this paper, we present learnings and insights from ten years of operating and maintaining a visualization center with large-scale immersive displays and installations. Our report focuses on the installations themselves as well as the various developments of the center over time. In addition, we discuss the advantages, challenges, and future development of a location-based VR center.},
