        abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) can be found in many fields. A majority of the time this involves the use of Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs). Their alternatives, large-scale immersive 3D screens and CAVE systems, can also be found in research and offer researchers high visual quality and collaborative VR experiences. This report covers the operation and learnings from maintaining a visualization center with large-scale immersive installations over the course of ten years.},
