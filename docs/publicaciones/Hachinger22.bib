abstract="Traditional usage models of Supercomputing centres have been extended by High-Throughput Computing (HTC), High-Performance Data Analytics (HPDA) and Cloud Computing. The complexity of current compute platforms calls for solutions to simplify usage and conveniently orchestrate computing tasks. These enable also non-expert users to efficiently execute Big Data workflows. In this context, the LEXIS project (`Large-scale EXecution for Industry and Society', H2020 GA 825532, https://lexis-project.eu) sets up an orchestration platform for compute- and data-intensive workflows. Its main objective is to implement a front-end and interfaces/APIs for distributed data management and workflow orchestration. The platform uses an open-source Identity and Access Management solution and a custom billing system. The data management API allows data ingestion and staging between various infrastructures. The orchestration API allows execution of workflows specified in extended TOSCA. LEXIS uses innovative technologies like YORC and Alien4Cloud for orchestration or iRODS/EUDAT-B2SAFE for data management, accelerated by Burst Buffers. Three pilot use cases from Aeronautics Engineering, Earthquake/Tsunami Analysis, and Weather and Climate Prediction are used to test the services. On the road towards longer-term sustainability, we are expanding this user base and aiming at the immersion of more Supercomputing centres within the platform.",
