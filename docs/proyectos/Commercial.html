<h2>
ARGlasses Project
</h2>
<p>
    2022-2024<br />
    This project investigated the challenges posed by the use of Augmented Reality glasses in the automotive sector.<br />
    The project included research-oriented investigations and proofs of concepts, and at the later stages, the design of a commercial product (series development).<br />
    The following challenges were investigated:
</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Investigation of enhanced tracking techniques for moving vehicles.</li>
    <li>Communication with vehicle, retrieval of accurate information from vehicle and backend services.</li>
    <li>Integration with external data sources like web.</li>
    <li>Multi-user support.</li>
    <li>Investigation of multiple augmented reality systems with different capabilities and price points.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Solutions and Mitigations investigated:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Development of time synchronization algorithms.</li>
        <li>Development and implementation of algorithms to authenticate and request information from vehicle and backend service.</li>
    <li>Preparation of configuration data to map vehicle types and user preferences to asset placements.</li>
    <li>Development of guidelines to develop applications which can run both in the car display and in the virtual world, 
        and methods to let the user drag and drop an application from the car display into the virtual world and back.</li>
    <li>Development and implementation of communication algorithms for shared world experiences.</li>
    <li>Use of game engines and standardized augmented reality frameworks where possible to ease development and help with portability of developed solutions.</li>
    <li>Use of high-end, state of the art augmented reality hardware to develop previews of the expected landscape of affordable products in a medium-scale timeframe (5-10 years), and showcase usecases.</li>
    <li>Use of mid-range augmented reality hardware to showcase minimum-viable-product (MVP) usecases for currently available, affordable devices ready for market adoption.</li>
    </ul>
